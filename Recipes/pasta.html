    <h3> The most recognized history of pasta is attributed to the discovery of Marco Polo in the thirteenth century,
        who introduced it to Italy back from one of his trips to China, in 1271. ... Therefore, fresh pasta was used and
        appreciated in Italy since the time of the Etruscans and the Romans. </h3>
